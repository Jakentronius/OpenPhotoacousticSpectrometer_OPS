/*
This code sets pin 18, GPIO, of an ESP-32 to High and Low on a duty cycle set by delay below.
The code is not optimal, heck it's barely functional, but it works well enough to drive the gate-pin of a MOSFET to gate larger loads.


Said code was used to gate a N-Channel MOSFET 60V 30A, specifically the FQP30N06L 60V LOGIC N-Channel MOSFET from Sparkfun
