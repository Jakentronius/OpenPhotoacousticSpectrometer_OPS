# OpenPhotoacousticSpectrometer_OPS
This is a repository intended to hold/publish/distribute documents pertaining to the Open Photoacoustic Spectrometer (OPS), an attempt at building a photoacoustic spectrometer on the cheap for either lab, shop or home use.

In doc's, you'll find some background literature on the photoacoustic effect and photothermal effect, as well as other resources and hackaday projects trying to impliment their version of the technology.

Images of our current prototype/first experiments for proof of concept, the device block diagram, datasheets for relevent components, and an explanation of the project can be found in the src folder.  

Current and Future Plans:
20231106- Having demonstrated a proof of concept, we now intend to develop a system capable of storing the driving signal and microphone output for futher processing. We will also begin implimenting a variable driven monochromator to replace the laser and allow us to sweep the incident light wavelength through the optical spectra.
